Q1. Write a Program that generates a set s1 of 10 even numbers and another set s2, of 10 odd numbers and Do the operation of union, intersection, difference, symmetric difference of sets s1 and s2. 

s1 =  {i for i in range(2,21,2)}
s2 =  {i for i in range(1,20,2)}
print(s1)
print(s2)

#opeartions
print("Union = ",s1|s2)
print("Intersection = ",s1&s2)
print("Difference = ",s1-s2,s2-s1)
print("Symmetric difference = ",s1^s2)
